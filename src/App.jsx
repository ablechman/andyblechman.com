                Co-founded Bottle.com with Will. All-in-one software for food entrepreneurs 
                to sell online. Partnered with local business owners to help them create 
                better businesses. (~10M healthy meals sold)
              </li>
              <li>
                Launched Southfork in Atlanta, a virtual cafeteria concept for companies. 
                Learned about food delivery before pivoting to Bottle.
              </li>
              <li>
                Two tours at SiteCompli with Jason and Ross. First helping grow from 5 to ~20 
                employees, then during scaling post-capital injection.
              </li>
              <li>
                Pre-revenue and pre-funding at Accordion. Learned what it takes to start a business. 
                Wore a lot of hats but technically was the COO where I focused on staffing, recruiting, 
                and business operations.
              </li>
              <li>
                Started off in finance because it was what my friends in college were doing. 
                Wish I'd been more thoughtful here, but it worked out.
